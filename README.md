**Losing through loss yet learning what ____s call.**
**To sell a moment, then ______ it from time,**
**An empty heart echoes — a ______ without rhyme.**

**I’ve had insufficient hope of ______ to be still,**
**Once released from the current, now _____ by will.**

**The individual drifts into the ______’s soft light.**

**From work to ____, from misleading to ______,**
**A salad becomes _____ — both fortune and fate.**
**And life, like warm soup or sweet _____ at ease,**
