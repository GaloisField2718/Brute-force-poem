# Quick Start Guide - After Audit
**Updated:** 2025-10-18  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes applied, ready to run

---

## üöÄ Ready to Run?

The system has been fully audited and all critical bugs fixed. Follow these steps:

### 1. Verify Build
```bash
cd /workspace
npm run build
```
Expected: `‚úì Success` with no errors

### 2. Check Configuration
```bash
# Verify your .env has OpenRouter API key
cat .env | grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# Verify balance sources are configured
cat config/bitcoin-sources.json
```

Expected configuration:
- ‚úÖ Bitcoin RPC enabled (priority 1)
- ‚úÖ Electrum enabled (priority 2)
- ‚úÖ APIs disabled (priority 3)

### 3. Start the Search
```bash
npm start
```

Watch for these key log messages:
```
‚úÖ [info]: Configuration valid
‚úÖ [info]: Bitcoin RPC initialized
‚úÖ [info]: Electrum initialized
‚úÖ [info]: Balance checker initialized {"availableSources":["bitcoin-rpc","electrum"]}
‚úÖ [info]: Position 12 constraints enabled
‚úÖ [info]: Beam search complete {"uniqueSeeds":10000,"duplicatesSkipped":0}
‚úÖ [info]: Checking 10000 seeds with 8 workers
‚úÖ [info]: Checkpoint written {"checkedCount":100}
```

---

## üìä What to Monitor

### Good Signs ‚úÖ
```
duplicatesSkipped: 0              # No duplicates = fix working
uniqueSeeds: 10000                # All unique = deduplication working
Checkpoint written every 100      # Persistence working
Balance check success             # Bitcoin RPC/Electrum working
```

### Warning Signs ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
[error]: All API endpoints failed      # OK if APIs disabled
[warn]: Duplicates found               # Should NOT see this (should be 0)
[error]: Bitcoin RPC connection failed # Check Bitcoin Core is running
[error]: Electrum connection failed    # Will fallback to next source
```

---

## üõë If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: Duplicates Found
```bash
[warn]: Duplicates found in candidate seeds {"duplicates":234}
```
**Cause:** Beam search generated duplicates (shouldn't happen with fixes)  
**Impact:** Minor - they're filtered out, but indicates beam search issue  
**Action:** Report to developer, but system will continue working

### Problem: No Checkpoints Written
```bash
# After 500 seeds checked, no checkpoint logs
```
**Cause:** Results directory not writable  
**Fix:**
```bash
mkdir -p results
chmod 755 results
```

### Problem: Crash and Can't Resume
```bash
$ npm start
[info]: Loaded previously checked seeds {"count":0}  # Should be > 0
```
**Cause:** Checkpoint file not found or corrupted  
**Fix:** Check `results/` directory for checkpoint files:
```bash
ls -la results/checkpoint-*.json
```
If missing, system will start fresh (safe but slower)

### Problem: Balance Checks Failing
```bash
[error]: All API endpoints failed
[error]: All balance check sources failed
```
**Cause:** Bitcoin RPC and Electrum both down  
**Fix:**
1. Check Bitcoin Core is running: `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo`
2. Check Electrum config in `config/bitcoin-sources.json`
3. As last resort, re-enable APIs (but they'll be slow)

---

## ‚è∏Ô∏è To Stop and Resume

### Stop Safely
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal
^C
[info]: Received SIGINT, shutting down gracefully
[info]: Worker pool shut down
```

System will:
- Finish current seed checks
- Write final checkpoint
- Exit cleanly

### Resume Later
```bash
npm start
```

System will:
- Load checkpoint automatically
- Skip already-checked seeds
- Continue from where it stopped

```
[info]: Loaded previously checked seeds {"count":3456}
[info]: Filtered out previously checked seeds {
  "original": 10000,
  "unchecked": 6544,
  "skipped": 3456
}
[info]: Checking 6544 seeds with 8 workers
```

---

## üéØ When Wallet is Found

### System Will:
1. Stop all workers immediately
2. Log wallet details:
```
[info]: üéØ WALLET FOUND! üéØ {
  "address": "bc1...",
  "path": "m/84'/0'/0'/0/0",
  "balance": 100000
}
```
3. Save to files:
   - `results/found-wallets-{timestamp}.json`
   - `results/FOUND-{timestamp}.json` (backup)
4. Exit cleanly

### You Should:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** backup the found wallet files
2. Move to encrypted storage
3. **NEVER** commit to git
4. **NEVER** share publicly

---

## üìÅ Files to Check

### During Run
- `logs/app-*.log` - Detailed logs
- `results/checkpoint-*.json` - Progress checkpoint

### After Completion
- `results/summary-*.json` - Statistics
- `results/found-wallets-*.json` - If found (SECURE THIS!)

---

## üîß Troubleshooting Commands

### Check System Status
```bash
# See if process is running
ps aux | grep node

# Check recent logs
tail -f logs/app-*.log

# Check checkpoint
cat results/checkpoint-*.json | jq '.checkedCount'

# Check results directory
ls -lah results/
```

### Performance Check
```bash
# Monitor CPU usage
top -p $(pgrep -f "node.*main.js")

# Monitor memory
free -h

# Check disk space
df -h .
```

### Test Configuration
```bash
# Test OpenRouter connection
npm run verify

# Test Bitcoin RPC
bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo

# Test Electrum
el getinfo
```

---

## üìà Expected Timeline

With current configuration (10,000 seeds):

### With Bitcoin RPC (Fastest)
- **Speed:** 1-2 seeds/second
- **Total time:** 1.4 - 2.8 hours
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Best option if you have Bitcoin Core

### With Electrum (Medium)
- **Speed:** 0.5-1 seeds/second  
- **Total time:** 2.8 - 5.5 hours
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Good if no Bitcoin Core

### With APIs (Slow)
- **Speed:** 0.1-0.3 seeds/second
- **Total time:** 9-28 hours
- **Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Only as last resort (rate limited)

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before running the full 10,000 seed search:

- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] Bitcoin RPC or Electrum working
- [ ] OpenRouter API key configured
- [ ] Enough disk space: `df -h .` (need ~1 GB free)
- [ ] Enough RAM: `free -h` (need ~2 GB free)
- [ ] Terminal session persistent (use `screen` or `tmux`)
- [ ] Checkpoint directory writable: `ls -ld results/`

All checked? **You're ready to go!**

```bash
npm start
```
